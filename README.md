# Melting Snowman
This is a mini-game about word guessing.
Basically, there is an ASCII image representing a snowman (ref. below).
You are prompted to guess a word by choosing individual letters. If a letter is part ofg the word, you are told where in the word it occurs.
If the letter is not contained within the word the snowman melts by one level.
After four wrong guesses you lose the game.
